## Installing Rspec
Rspec will automaticly create a factories directory when a new model is created e.g scaffold so don't create it manually. I used this guide but placed config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods in the rails_helper.rb file.

#TODO: 
Clean up `config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods`
